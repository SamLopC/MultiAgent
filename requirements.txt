# Core Dependencies
# -----------------
# Python Version: Ensure Python 3.8 or later is used. This is not enforced by requirements.txt,
# but it is recommended.
pygame==2.1.2           # For real-time visualization and rendering

# (Optional) Visualization and Analysis Tools
# -------------------------------------------
matplotlib==3.6.2       # For plotting and further visual analytics of metrics
seaborn==0.12.1         # For advanced, publication-quality statistical plots
numpy==1.23.4           # Useful for grid manipulations, matrix operations, and potential optimizations
pandas==1.5.1           # For structured data handling, logging analysis, exporting metrics
scipy==1.9.3            # May help with advanced pathfinding heuristics or optimization routines

# (Optional) Reinforcement Learning & ML Support
# ----------------------------------------------
# If you decide to integrate advanced RL methods:
tensorflow==2.10.0       # Only if using TF-based RL methods
torch==1.12.1+cu116       # If using PyTorch-based RL approaches
stable-baselines3==1.6.2 # If using stable-baselines3 for RL algorithms

# (Optional) Developer Tools
# --------------------------
black==22.10.0           # For code formatting
flake8==5.0.4            # For linting and code style checks
pytest==7.2.0            # For running tests and continuous integration
mypy==0.991              # For optional static type checking

# (Optional) Performance and Debugging Tools
# ------------------------------------------
tqdm==4.64.1             # Progress bars for longer simulations or batch experiments
line-profiler==3.5.1     # For performance profiling of the code



# For minimum functionality (just running the main simulation with Pygame), you primarily need pygame.
# For logging, standard Python libraries (like logging and random) are included by default and do not need to be installed separately.
# If you want to analyze results and produce plots or advanced RL experiments, install the additional packages as needed.
