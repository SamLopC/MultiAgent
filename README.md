## Overview

This repository showcases a sophisticated **multi-agent pathfinding and collision avoidance** simulation in a 2D grid environment. Multiple autonomous "cars" navigate from randomly chosen start locations to designated target cells (often in a centralized goal region) while dynamically avoiding collisions, rerouting around obstacles, and interacting with one another through a shared state and communication protocols.

The environment supports:
- Multiple pathfinding algorithms (A*, BFS, Dijkstra) that run adaptively.
- Variable terrain costs and moving obstacles for increased complexity.
- Agent-to-agent communication and prioritized yield requests.
- Basic reinforcement learning signals guiding algorithm choice.
- Centralized vs. decentralized control configurations.
- Real-time visualization using Pygame.

This project was built to explore advanced concepts in artificial intelligence, multi-agent coordination, and dynamic decision-making in constrained environments.

## Key Features

1. **Multiple Agents with Differing Roles & Priorities:**
   - Leaders, followers, and normal agents.
   - Priority-based yielding and path adjustments.

2. **Pathfinding & Rerouting:**
   - Agents use A*, BFS, or Dijkstra’s algorithm.
   - If one algorithm fails, agents try another.
   - Agents adapt paths in real-time in response to environmental changes.

3. **Collision Avoidance & Communication:**
   - Agents detect occupied cells and either negotiate passage or reroute.
   - Yield requests and path broadcasts encourage cooperative navigation.
   
4. **Dynamic & Complex Environment:**
   - Randomly placed static obstacles.
   - Occasional obstacle movement or removal.
   - Variable terrain costs introducing slower cells.
   - Support for large grid sizes and more than 10 agents.

5. **Reinforcement Learning Signals (Prototype):**
   - Basic Q-learning style updates to prefer successful algorithms.
   - Epsilon-greedy algorithm selection for pathfinding.

6. **Scalability & Performance Tracking:**
   - Easily test scenarios with tens of agents.
   - Logs important metrics: collisions, finish times, synergy bonuses, etc.

## Project Goals and Scope

**Primary Objectives:**
- Demonstrate how multiple autonomous agents can navigate a shared, constrained environment efficiently.
- Implement real-time collision avoidance and pathfinding adaptation.
- Explore decentralized vs. centralized control approaches.
- Integrate basic RL signals into multi-agent navigation scenarios.

**Scope:**
This project is a simulation and does not directly integrate with hardware. It focuses on algorithmic complexity, multi-agent coordination, and performance evaluation rather than a fully polished RL training pipeline or a production-ready system.

---

## Technologies & Dependencies

- **Language:** Python 3.8+ (Recommended)
- **Libraries:**
  - [Pygame](https://www.pygame.org/) for visualization
  - [logging](https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html) for structured event logging
  - [random](https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html) for stochastic placements and movements
  - [heapq, collections] standard Python libraries for priority queues and BFS

No external ML frameworks are required. Reinforcement learning in this project is implemented with simple dictionary-based Q-values.

## Project Structure

```
.
├─ main.py               # Main entry point for simulation
├─ car.py                # Car (agent) class: pathfinding, movement, RL signals
├─ shared_state.py        # SharedState class: holds grid, obstacles, communication
├─ grid.py               # Helper functions to draw grid and target zone
├─ config.py             # Configuration constants (GRID_SIZE, CELL_SIZE, FPS, etc.)
├─ logs.log              # Generated log file with simulation details
├─ requirements.txt       # Python dependencies (if used)
└─ README.md             # This documentation file
```

**Key Classes & Modules:**
- **Car:** Represents each agent. Handles path calculation, movement, RL updates, and communication responses.
- **SharedState:** Maintains global environment state, obstacles, cell occupancy, messaging between agents, and environment modifications.
- **grid.py:** Rendering logic for visualization.
- **config.py:** Central place to adjust parameters like grid size, target zone size, and FPS.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/multi-agent-pathfinding.git
   cd multi-agent-pathfinding
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install pygame
   ```
   Additional dependencies (if any) can be installed from `requirements.txt`:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Check Python Environment:**
   Ensure you’re running Python 3.8 or higher:
   ```bash
   python --version
   ```

---

## Usage

1. **Running the Simulation:**
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
   The simulation opens a Pygame window. Agents begin navigating, and logs are recorded in `logs.log`.

2. **Adjusting the Number of Agents:**
   Modify the `main()` call in `main.py`:
   ```python
   if __name__ == "__main__":
       main(num_cars=20)
   ```

   Increase `num_cars` to test scalability.

3. **Exiting the Simulation:**
   - Close the Pygame window.
   - Or wait for the simulation timeout or completion (all cars reach targets).

---

## Simulation Parameters

Some parameters you may want to tweak in `config.py` or directly in `main()`:

- **GRID_SIZE:** Size of the grid (default 50x50).
- **TARGET_ZONE_SIZE:** Size of the central target area.
- **FPS:** Frames per second for visualization.
- **move_delay:** Delay between agent moves in milliseconds.

You can also tweak `centralized_control = True/False` and adjust the frequencies of obstacle movements and cost increases.

## Pathfinding Algorithms Implemented

**A***: Heuristic-driven shortest-path search using Manhattan distance. Fastest when a good heuristic is available.

**Breadth-First Search (BFS):** Algorithm for shortest paths in unweighted graphs. Guaranteed shortest path if all costs are equal.

**Dijkstra’s Algorithm:** General shortest-path search for weighted graphs, useful when cell traversal costs vary.

Agents try A* first, then fallback to BFS, then Dijkstra if no solution is found.

---

## Advanced Concepts Implemented

- **Collision Avoidance:** Agents detect when the next cell is occupied and attempt communication (yield requests) or path re-calculation.
- **Prioritization:** Higher priority cars (leaders) have the right of way. Lower priority cars yield or reroute.
- **Communication Protocols:**
  - **Yield Requests:** A car requests another car to yield if that car has lower priority.
  - **Path Broadcasts:** A car broadcasts its path so others can avoid it.
- **Dynamic Environment:**
  - Random obstacle movement, adding, or removing obstacles during runtime.
  - Increasing cell traversal costs to simulate changing terrain.
- **Reinforcement Learning Signals:**
  - Simple Q-learning style updates to prefer successful algorithms for pathfinding.
  - Epsilon-greedy algorithm selection.
  - Reward signals for reaching the target, penalties for collisions or being stuck.
- **Centralized vs. Decentralized Control:** Option to have a global controller recalculate paths or let each agent act independently.

---

## Visualization

The Pygame window shows:
- **Grid Cells:** Each cell in the grid. Certain cells might be darker or have colors representing costs or obstacles.
- **Cars:**  
  - **Leaders:** Displayed with a special colored border for easy recognition.  
  - **Followers & Normal Cars:** Displayed in distinct colors from `CAR_COLORS`.
- **Visited Trails:** Agents leave a colored trail marking their path history.
- **Target Zone:** Highlighted central cells forming a “goal area.”

As simulation runs, watch agents move, reroute, and interact.

## Performance Metrics & Logging

Metrics collected and logged in `logs.log` and printed at simulation end:

- **Total Collisions:** How many times agents got “stuck” or blocked.
- **Cars Finished:** How many agents reached their targets.
- **Average Finish Time:** Average time for successful journeys.
- **Path Algo Switch Count:** How often agents switched between A*, BFS, and Dijkstra.
- **Yield Requests & Honors:** How often yield requests were sent and honored.
- **Synergy Bonus:** Extra reward for followers finishing close in time to their leader.

---

## Example Results

For a 20-car scenario:
- Average finish time: ~45 seconds
- Total collisions: ~10
- Yields honored: ~5
- Synergy bonus: Earned when followers finished within 10 seconds of their leader.

(Your results may vary based on configuration and randomness.)

---

## Known Issues & Limitations

- **Partial RL Implementation:** The reinforcement learning aspect is rudimentary and not fully trained or stable.
- **No Real-Time Parameter Tuning:** Changes to strategies or constants require code edits.
- **Limited Scalability:** While you can run many agents, performance may degrade on very large grids or with very high agent counts.
- **No Persistent RL State:** Q-values reset each run since no external saving/loading is implemented.

---

## Future Improvements

- **Advanced RL Integration:** Use stable RL libraries (e.g., Stable Baselines3) for learning policies over many episodes.
- **More Complex Communication:** Add richer messaging protocols, sharing intentions, and cooperative path planning.
- **GUI Controls:** Add a GUI panel to adjust parameters mid-simulation.
- **Data Export:** Export run metrics (finish times, collisions) in CSV format for analysis and benchmarking.
- **Formation Control:** Enhance the logic for followers maintaining formation with their leader more intelligently.
- **Policy Persistence:** Save Q-values or learned policies to disk and re-load them for continuous training.
